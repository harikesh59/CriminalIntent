# OFFICEIntent

OfficeIntent records the details of “office crimes” – things like leaving dirty dishes in the breakroom sink or walking away from
an empty shared printer after documents have printed.
With OfficelIntent, you can make a record of a crime including a title, a date, and a photo. 
You can also identify a suspect from your contacts and lodge a complaint via email, Twitter, Facebook, or another app.
After documenting and reporting a crime, you can proceed with your work free of resentment and ready to focus on the business at hand.
